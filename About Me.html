        <p>My name is Mohammed Obaydul Hoque Chowdhury.</p>
        <p>Currently working as a Technical Business Analyst at FDM Group and contracted out to work for HSBC.</p>

        <p>One of my proudest achievements has been completing my final year project with only one working arm at the time, where I gained a lot of patience and perseverance skills while also using my problem solving skills to make sure the project is completed on time. </p>
        <p>Outside of work, I love to play/watch football, watch anime. As of right now health and fitness is a big part of my life as i go gym 6 days a week.</p>
